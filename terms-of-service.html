        <b>5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>5.1. Ownership of Services; License to Services - Excluding any open source software (as further described in Section 5.2) or third-party software that the Portal or the Services incorporates, as between you and DigitaloFX, DigitaloFX owns the Portal and the Services, including all technology, content and other materials used, displayed or provided on the Portal or in connection with the Services (including all intellectual property rights subsisting therein), and hereby grants you a limited, revocable, transferable, license to access and use those portions of the Portal and the Services that are proprietary to DigitaloFX</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>5.2. DigitaloFX License; Open Source Software License; Limitations - The Portal and the Services are governed by the most recent version of the open-source license commonly known as the “Apache License 2.0, a copy of which&nbsp; (as of the date these Terms were last updated) and any other applicable licensing terms for the Portal and the Services in these Terms (collectively, the “DigitaloFX License”). You acknowledge that the Portal or the Services may use, incorporate or link to certain open-source components and that your use of the Portal or Services is subject to, and you will comply with any, applicable open-source licenses that govern any such open-source components (collectively, “Open-Source Licenses”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may not: (a) resell, lease, lend, share, distribute, or otherwise permit any third party to use the Portal or the Services; (b) use the Portal or the Services for time-sharing or service bureau purposes; or (c) otherwise use the Portal or the Services in a manner that violates the DigitaloFX License or any other Open-Source Licenses.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>5.3. Trademarks - Any of DigitaloFX product or service names, logos, and other marks used in the Portal or as a part of the Services, including DigitaloFX name and logo are trademarks owned by DigitaloFX, its Affiliates or its applicable licensors. You may not copy, imitate, or use them without DigitaloFX's (or the applicable licensor’s) prior written consent.</p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">5.5. You Retain Possession and Ownership of Your Assets - Trading on DigitaloFX is offered as a non-custodial service. When you deposit assets into an account in the DigitaloFX smart contract, you retain control over those assets at all times. This is the case because the private key associated with your Ethereum address (the address from which you deposited assets) is the only private key that can control the funds in the DigitaloFX account. You cannot withdraw assets from DigitaloFX to any Ethereum address other than the address from which you deposited assets. To the extent that we have any ability to modify any smart contract code in such a way that would affect your possession of or access to your assets, we will only exercise such ability in good faith, and in your best interests, under our continuing obligation to preserve your ownership of and access to your assets. If we were to ever take actual or constructive possession of your assets, we would do so subject to all of your rights as the legal owner of those assets.</span><br></p></div>

</div>

<div>
    <p>6.2. No Liability - We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any Services or from any suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Portal or the Services.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        <b>9. DISCLOSURES; DISCLAIMERS</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>DigitaloFXis a developer of open-source software. Deluxe 4 does not operate a virtual currency or derivatives exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and therefore has no oversight, involvement, or control with respect to your transactions. All transactions between users of DigitaloFX open-source software are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users’ digital wallets through a smart contract.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Under U.S. federal law, unless you are an “eligible contract participant” as defined in 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18), your transaction must settle within 28 days. Individuals who do not have more than $10 million invested on a discretionary basis (or $5 million if the transaction is for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred) are not eligible contract participants and may not enter into transactions using the DigitaloFX open-source software that does not result in the actual delivery of virtual currency within 28 days.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>You understand that Margin Positions generated using the DigitaloFX open-source software are commodity contracts. Margin Positions are not shares or any equivalent in any existing or future public or private company, corporation, or other entity in any jurisdiction.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>DigitaloFX does not own or control the underlying software protocols that are used in connection with Margin Positions. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. DigitaloFX is not responsible for the operation of the underlying protocols, and DigitaloFX makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Portal and the Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of us are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including, without limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the Portal or the Services (including any data relating thereto) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time, or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Portal or the Service are correctable or will be correctable.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>You acknowledge that your data on the Portal may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses or other technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect your computer equipment), protocol changes by third-party providers, Internet outages, force majeure events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or outside our control.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>The disclaimer of implied warranties contained herein may not apply if and to the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under the Applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which you reside.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        <b>10. EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>In no event shall we (together with our Affiliates, including our and our Affiliates’ respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers or contractors) be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data, information, revenue, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Portal and the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Ether, Margin Positions or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of us, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not we have been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy hereunder nor is DigitaloFX in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of DigitaloFX open-source software.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        <b>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>In no event shall our aggregate liability (together with our Affiliates, including our and our Affiliates’ respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, or contractors) arising out of or in connection with the Portal and the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or nonperformance of the Services, your Ether, Margin Positions or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of us, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability exceed the number of fees paid by you to us under these Terms, if any, in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        <b>12. GOVERNING LAW</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Portal or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of England, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the England parliament or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the state and federal courts located in London, England will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        <b>13. MISCELLANEOUS</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Any right or remedy of DigitaloFX set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law, or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect. We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Portal or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, the action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. You may not assign or transfer any right to use the Portal or the Services, or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. We may assign or transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Headings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Portal and the Services. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.</p>
